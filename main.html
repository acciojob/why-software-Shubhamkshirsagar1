	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to be a software engineer because it is a profession that combines my interests in technology, problem solving, and working with people. As a software engineer, I would have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, using different programming languages and tools. I would also be able to collaborate with other engineers to design and build new applications or improve existing ones.
